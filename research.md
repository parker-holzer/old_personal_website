* **A Hermite-Gaussian Based Radial Velocity Estimation Method**: The radial velocity method is one of the techniques used to detect the signal of a planet orbiting a distant star by analyzing the light from that star. This project uses the Hermite-Gaussian functions to mathematically formulate the radial velocity method as weighted linear regression. This is shown through both simulation studies and analysis of real data to outperform the traditional cross-correlation function approach.

* **A Stellar Activity F-statistic for Exoplanet Surveys (SAFE)**: In the radial velocity method for finding exoplanets, stellar activity in the atmosphere of the host star can distort the signal imposed by the orbiting planet. This project introduces a new statistic designed to detect the presence of such stellar activity. We demonstrate that this new F-statistic behaves as expected when no stellar activity is present, and has higher statistical power than many traditional stellar activity indicators designed for the same purpose.
