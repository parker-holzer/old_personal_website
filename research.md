* *A Hermite-Gaussian Based Radial Velocity Estimation Method*: The radial velocity method is one of the techniques used to detect the signal of a planet orbiting a distant star by analyzing the light from that star. This project uses the Hermite-Gaussian functions to mathematically formulate the radial velocity method as weighted linear regression. This is shown through both simulation studies and analysis of real data to outperform the traditional cross-correlation function approach.
