# About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Yale University. My research interests primarily center on interpretable machine learning, unified statistical approaches that use both bayesian and frequentist techniques, and applications to the hard sciences. I have an amazing wife and two wonderful sons!
